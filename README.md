* Download the server.js file
* Run the command "node server" in the directory where the server.js file exists.
* When running the command for the first time:
** This initiates the creation of store.js and asks you to provide location for master storage, if failed to assign storage it assigns to the default C:\Master directory
* When running the command after that:
** The directory has already been initialised, it provides 3 options: 1. Create 2. Read and 3. Delete
